# Steering-Behaviors
C++ 2D implementation of Craig Reynolds steering behaviors found in Artificial Intelligence for Games (Third Edition).

Note: This repo does not showcase any examples of how the steerings can be used within a movement controller as of now.

## Features
- Polymorphism based implementations.
- Steering behaviors - ISteering(base class), Align, Cohesion, Separation, Face, Wander, Arrive.
- Kinematic class.
- SteeringOutput - Linear and angular.
